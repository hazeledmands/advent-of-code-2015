# Advent of Code 2015

Here's the code I've written to solve the [2015 Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2015). **Warning: contains spoilers!**

Things are written in JS, and runnable in node >= v14.

```
npm install
npm run solve
```

If you'd like to see solutions for earlier days, you'll find them in the git history.
